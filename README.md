# Galaban's Simple timer
This is a small, simple timer for the LOTJ mud.  I based the UI on Johnson's UI so that it matched the rest of my mud window.

To use this, use the command:

     timer <len> <title>

Such as:  timer 60 One Minuite Timer

## To install
1. Download the raw file from github:
https://raw.github.com/galaban/LOTJGenericTimer/master/Galabans_GenericTimer.xml
2. Place the raw file into your "plugins" directory.  This is fund in your Mushclient folder under /worlds/plugins.
3. Install the plugain in MushClient.  From the "File" menu, choose "plugins", then "Add".  Select the file and choose "OK".
